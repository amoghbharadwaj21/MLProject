                <p>The goal of this project is to analyze and understand how various factors influence students' test performance. Specifically, the focus is on the following aspects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Analysis</strong>: Evaluating how test scores vary with respect to different influencing variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Influencing Variables</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gender</strong>: The gender of the students and its potential impact on test scores.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: The ethnic background of students and its correlation with their performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parental Level of Education</strong>: How the highest level of education attained by the student's parents affects their test scores.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lunch</strong>: The type of lunch students receive (standard vs. free/reduced) and its effect on performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test Preparation Course</strong>: Whether students completed a test preparation course and how this impacts their test scores.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>By analyzing these variables, the project aims to uncover patterns and relationships that could provide insights into educational outcomes and help in formulating strategies to improve student performance.</p>
